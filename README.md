# Voice Controlled Car

The purpose of this project is to create a voice controlled vehicle combining a neural network and arudino. I used a data set from Kaggle that contained sound files of simple spoken words. I extracted spectrograms (visual representations of sound) from these audio files using librosa. I trained a neural network with Keras to recognize those words. I then built a car that is controlled by an arduino. I used py audio to record voices, py serial to communicate with the arduino bluetooth, and the arduino software to control the car. You can find a video of the car embedded in the presentation.

Process:
1) Obtain data from Kaggle and extract spectrograms
2) Train Neural Network
3) Connect neural network to arudino
4) [Presentation (Contains video of car in action!)](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1WDjfSdXJxMTSl_K7_u0fM6tv5v-i54fAw8-XslhkJS8/edit?usp=sharing)
